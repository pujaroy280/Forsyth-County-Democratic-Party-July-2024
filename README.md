## General Git primer
### Realistically, you won't need to do much complicated with Github for the purposes of the Fellowship. Here are the core commands you'll need to use:
```
git clone [repository link here]
git pull 
git add . 
git commit -m "[enter message]"
(or git commit -am "" to combine git add . and git commit -m together)
git push 

```

### Git collaboration tips: 

1. This is something that will need to be discussed amongst your team members. 
2. If you'll be starting off working in completely separate files, then perhaps using one master branch to collaborate makes the most sense. 
3. However, if you're working on an intertwined project where everyone might be touching the same file at some point, perhaps isolate your own work on your own branch and have an updated master branch where you can pull from for updates from other members. This keeps the work more clean and easier to figure out what code needs to be focused on if there are conflicts and/or errors. 
4. You can visually manage branching, pull requests, and hosting sites / apps on GitHub.
